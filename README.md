# FP4-proposal
Project Proposal is due 2015-04-08 at 8am

Produce a plan for your final project, and prepare an in-class presentation.

Ask questions, as always, [on piazza!][piazza]

## Written Proposal Instructions

Teams will submit ONE written proposal, with sections that each member has done individually detailing their proposed contributions. The submission will be on github, as a pull request of this very file. Below is a template proposal report.

You should be proposing something that you have high confidence that you can achieve, and the proposal should project that confidence.
The proposal should be no longer than necessary, but long enough to include critical detail. Three pages is appropriate. Diagrams are welcome. 

Remember, you can do some neat [formatting things with Markdown.][markdown]

## In-Class Presentation Instructions
Teams will each deliver an in-class presentation. **Presentations will be Wednesday, April 8** (and Friday, April 10 as necessary). The presentation material is due on April 8 by 9 am for everybody. [See piazza for full schedule.][piazza]

Your team will have two minutes to present. Create presentation with two or three slides. Make the slides in google drive, and share the public-viewable link at the bottom of this report. The day of presentations, I'll have the list of links on the display computer, so each team can simply click their link and begin. 

(Template follows. You may delete this line and all above it. Please edit the following template to create your report.)

# Project Title: Card game - higher or lower
### Problem Statement
We intend to demonstrate cards library functionality using a simplified kids cards game called war. 

### Problem Analysis
•Data abstraction will used to manipulate the cards. 

• games/cards racket/gui racket/unit libraries will be used for implementing functions and sub functions


### Data set or other source materials
No external datasets used for this project

### Deliverable and Demonstration
The deliverables will be code and working application. The interactive game will be demonstrated for its functionality

### Evaluation of Results
Ability to executre the application without errors.

## Work Plan and Schedule
We are exploring  games/cards, racket/gui and racket/unit libraries. We will use features combined from different card games including memory, gofish and aces.

Once we understand how a library procedure is implemented based on the documentation and the example game, we will implement a modified version of it in our game.

### First Milestone (04-13)
We will deliver the conceptual document with high level overview of the application.

### Second Milestone (04-21)
Completed code displaying the screen with primitive functionality of deal and drawing cards.

## Group Responsibilities
We are a 2 member team and will have shared responsibilities for the code and documentation. We both would like to learn functions from the cards/games library and share.

### Anand Surisetti
will work on coding, testing and documentation.

### Liuchen Ye
will work on coding and testing.
